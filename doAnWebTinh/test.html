  If "Hanoi 36 streets" in the past was known as the land of "thousands of
  thousands of things", "First Kinh Ky, second Pho Hien", today, Hanoi Old
  Quarter has a gentle and mixed beauty. Ancient features of mossy tiled roofs.
  However, there is one thing that cannot be denied that somewhere in that
  peaceful and quiet beauty, sometimes we will encounter a little imprint of a
  bustling city in the past. No matter what form, Hanoi is always beautiful and
  lovely with its unique cultural features.
